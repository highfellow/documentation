Standing agenda for Lancaster And Morecambe Makers board meetings.

# Apologies

# The purpose of this meeting

The purpose of this meeting is to conduct the legal affairs of LAMM.

Items discussed within this meeting include legal, financial and code of
conduct related matters that very specifically should not be generally
discussed.

General discussion should be carried out after the main agenda items have
been dealt with under the proviso that these things do not bypass
discussion with the membership after the meeting.
