Code of Conduct
===============

This code of conduct is based on the one from Gothenburg Hackerspace (GHS).  The original can be found at [http://gbg.hackerspace.se/ghs/jargon][http://gbg.hackerspace.se/ghs/jargon]

Gothenburg Hackerspace (GHS) is an inclusive society where everyone is welcome regardless of age, ethnicity, gender, sexuality or religion - to discuss and learn more about technology in an environment of mutual respect, tolerance and encouragement. We want all participants to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Therefore, all participants are expected to be nice and respectful towards each other.

To clarify what is expected of members, everyone in Gothenburg Hackerspace is obliged to follow this code of conduct. It applies to all of the association's physical meetings, events and the like, as well as all communication channels and other virtual activities.

We strive to provide a fun, educational and friendly atmosphere in the club.

* Think about what you say. Remember that sexist, racist and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. They are not suitable in Gothenburg Hackerspace.

* Be nice to each other. Do not insult or act in a derogatory manner towards any participant. Participants violating these rules may be asked to leave Gothenburg Hackerspace immediately.

* Harassment includes offensive or unwanted comments about (for example) gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity or religion, pornographic pictures in public places (including slides and profile/avatar pictures), deliberate intimidation, stalking, unwanted photographs or recording, sustained disruption of talks, inappropriate physical contact and unwelcome sexual attention.

* Participants who are encouraged to stop their inappropriate behavior or their harassment are expected to do so immediately.

* If you observe a participant displaying improper behavior, you should contact Gothenburg Hackerspace immediately. The contact persons may be found [here][http://gbg.hackerspace.se/ghs/keymasters]. All complaints to Gothenburg Hackerspace will remain confidential, be taken seriously, investigated and dealt with appropriately.

* Gothenburg Hackerspace is aware of its responsibilities in ensuring its continuation as a successful and productive hackerspace. If an incident were to occur, Gothenburg Hackerspace will give a formal apology to the offended party and future actions will be taken to make sure this does not reoccur.

* Any or all of the following countermeasures are to be expected: the alleged offender may be requested to change their behavior. If the behavior continues, the alleged offender is to immediately leave the site and/or be prohibitied from participating in future events and the incident may be reported to the appropiate authorities (depending on severity) â€” this is however the very last resort, considering our interest in keeping things friendly and social for the benefit of everyone involved.

This Code applies to everyone involved in Gothenburg Hackerspace, in any capacity or form.

This Code of Conduct is a derivative of the one used in Crypto Party Stockholm.
