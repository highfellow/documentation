# Announcement of Annual General Meeting

Hi All,

The time has come for us to all gather in one place for the Annual General
Meeting ritual.

tl;dr:

**When**: Monday 15th February 2016 at 19:00 GMT

**Where**: Lancaster And Morecambe Makers, Unit 5 Sharpes Mill, LA1 4XS

**Proxy**: If you can't attend, let us know and we will arrange a proxy vote
for you.

**Agenda**: If you have any items for the agenda, email them to
lammspace@gmail.com.

**Deadlines**: Monday 8th of February at 19:00 GMT is the deadline for agenda
items, registering for proxy voting and for board nominations.

Details:

**What is this?** We are required to meet once a year for the board to present
the accounts, elect board members and discuss any items of significance
that the members wish to raise. This is your chance to have your say in how
the hackspace is run and decide on directions for the future.

**Why should I attend?** We will be discussing the future of the hackspace and
importantly will be asking you the members to approve a new legal document
on how the hackspace is run. We need a 75% majority of the membership to
approve this for it to pass and be adopted. Also we'll have some snacks and
drinks for socialising afterwards :)

**What legal document?** The running of the 'Lancaster And Morecambe Makers'
like all limited companies is governed by a document called the 'Articles
of Association'. When we founded the company, we chose to accept the model
articles which are generic which is why we now want to change them for
articles that have specifically been written with the hackspace in mind.

**Why is this legal document thingy important?** The articles of association
set out the terms by which the company operates, how and when we elect
board members, the purpose of the organisation and importantly how we hold
elections. This document is the agreement between the board and the members
for how the board should run the company on your behalf.

**Where can I find the existing articles of association to read them?**

**Where can I find the new articles of association to read them?**
https://github.com/lammspace/documentation/blob/master/articles/Proposed-Lancaster_And_Morecambe_Makers_M%26A.pdf

Printed copies of both of these documents are available for review in the
hackspace, please don't remove them :)

**What should I do if I have questions about the changes in the Articles of
Association?** Please email lammspace@gmail.com with your questions as soon
as possible, we'd very much like to avoid discussion of the details on the
night of the meeting and want people to read these documents well before
the meeting. The motion in front of the meeting will be to accept the new
articles so please ask your questions early.

**Who are the board and what do they do?** The board is the group elected
members responsible for the legal aspects of running the hackspace. Tis
includes sorting out accounts, making sure our bills are paid and ensuring
we have somewhere to hack.

**How do people get on the board?** The board is currently made up of the
inaugural members of the hackspace. Our new articles of association say
that we have to all step down at this AGM so that the members have the
option to nominate and elect different people.

**All the board are standing down at the AGM, why is that?** At the moment the
board aren't elected and as such, we will all be standing down at the AGM
because we want the members to make the decision on who those people should
be. This is stated in the new articles of association that we hope to adopt
at the meeting.

**How do I nominate someone for election to the board and is there a deadline?**
You need to send an email to lammspace@gmail.com with your nomination.
Nominations will only be accepted from and for current members of the
hackspace and only if the person nominated is willing to stand for
election. The deadline for nominations is at 19:00 on Monday 8th of
February 2016.

**When will this take place?** Monday 15th of February 2016 at 19:00.

**Where will this take place?** The Hackspace, Unit 5 Sharpes Mill, LA1 4XS

**What if I can't attend?** Let us know and we will sort out proxy voting for
you and give your apologies for being unable to attend. You need to let us
know if you want to proxy vote by 19:00 on Monday 8th of February 2016 so
that we can get you the paperwork and have it returned before the meeting.

**I want to talk about a thing, what should I do?** Reply to this email before
Monday 8th of February so that your item for discussion can be placed on
the agenda. The agenda for the meeting will be announced in advance of the
meeting and we won't be taking new items for discussion on the night to
keep the meeting short and focused. The reason for the deadline is that we
need to circulate the agenda in advance and allow those who are unable to
attend the ability to vote.

Look forward to seeing you on the 15th of February for this important
inaugural meeting.

Kind regards,

Ian on behalf of the board.
