# Report from the board - ClaireJ

Another year has past, and a great year it has been. Thank you to all the members for making LAMM what it is.

## An acknowledgement of donors

Andrews and Arnold have continued to provided us with internet, we have hosting from Bytemark. We are very grateful to these companies for their continued generosity.

If anybody has ideas for other sponsors have a discussion with the board.

## What we’ve done

We’ve done a lot more this past year.

We have the new 3d printer, enormous thanks to Andy and Gus for getting that up and running. We’ve sorted out more of the space, such as the laser storage and the letterpress is now in a usable condition. The rfid is nearly ready which will cut cost as we won't need to get so many keys cut.

We attended the UK Makerfaire where we were supposed to be sharing a table with Manchester Hacman, and have items from Swindon space. These spaces dropped out at the last second leaving us with three 6ft tables to cover. I have to say we did a marvelous job, We raided the space and took things from all areas from cosplay sword and shield, lasercut castle to free-standing lace and of course the infinity mirror. A big thanks to Kay for bringing lots of crochet and knitted items, as well as the small loom. And to the small team that made it all the way to Newcastle. I should like to add that people had not realise that the other hackspaces had not turned up

Lancaster had their first mini Fun palace and the destruction of allsorts of electronics went down very well, giving kids and adults the tools to take apart computers that they are normally not allowed to, is always going to excite the demolisher in all of us. Extremely good turn out to the event,  to the fact that we were asked to attend the full Fun Palace in October. 

But before that we had the Manchester Makefest, from past experience we had decided that having something interactive would be a good idea. As we had seen from the UK Makerfaire we had quite the variety of objects, but the part that we got a lot of interest was the textiles, being something that most people don’t believe hackspaces do. As we had short time to work out what to do. A quick and easy idea from Kay was to make small weaving looms and I’m sure you all saw us making small balls of wool and cardboard looms in the run up to the event. With two looms, our show box from the space and lots of yarn we did LAMM proud. It was a exhausting event and again I thank the small group who were there helping. 

October Fun Palace was soon upon us and we had decided to do the bugz workshop, with kind permission from Taz from Hacman. And the weave a pouch as we still had some left over from Manchester. Although we could not take money, we could ask for donation and as such ended up just covering costs. This was well worth all the effort that went in before the event all the cutting and staining and sorting of bug parts. And it has been great to be involved in this local even as this is where we can pull members from.

For Light up lancaster we were asked by the library to help out and we again dipped into all sorts of stuff that had anything to do with light, obviously the infinity mirror had an outing. Thanks to Andy for lending us his amazing light panel and for helping out, myself and Kay took our supply of EL wire and all the leds we could find and had a good crowd explaining the different type of lighting on show.

## Future initiatives.

Exhibiting at events cannot happen without the membership stepping up. That is why this year we will not be exhibiting at Newcastle or Manchester and will be focusing on local events. We cannot do these events without your help. We need ideas and definitely need people to come to the events and help on the stall.

Events for this year as it stands at the moment will be:

* Lancaster Pride
* Fun Palace  (October)
* Light up Lancaster (November)

Although last year we discussed finding a bigger space, we do not believe this is feasible at the moment so we need to make the best of the space we have. Can we remind all members to clean up after yourselves and leave the space how you would want to find it.  Thanks and a reminder.  We cannot do this without you, so I take this opportunity to that you all for being part of this. And obviously to thank the rest of the board for their continuing hard work.

Let’s make 2017 even better that 2016
